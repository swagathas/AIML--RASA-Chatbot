# AIML--RASA-Chatbot

## Problem Statement
An Indian startup named 'Foodie' wants to build a conversational bot (chatbot) which can help users discover restaurants across several Indian cities. You have been hired as the lead data scientist for creating this product.

#### The main purpose of the bot is to help users discover restaurants quickly and efficiently and to provide a good restaurant discovery experience. The project brief provided to you is as follows.

You need to accomplish the following in the project:

1.NLU training: You can use rasa-nlu-trainer to create more training examples for entities and intents. Try using regex features and synonyms for extracting entities.

2.Build actions for the bot. You need to extract the list of restaurants from the dataset, based on the user's preference of location, cuisine & budget. Once extracted you need to sort the list based on top 5 restaurant’s user rating. You also need to build an ‘action’ for sending emails from Python.

3.Creating more stories:  Refer to the sample conversational stories provided above.  You can add them directly to the stories file or save them through interactive mode. Your bot will be evaluated on something similar to the test stories shared.
